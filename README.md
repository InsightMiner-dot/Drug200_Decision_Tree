## About the dataset

**You have collected data about a set of patients, all of whom suffered from the same illness. During their course of treatment, each patient responded to one of 5 medications, Drug A, Drug B, Drug c, Drug x and y.**

**Part of your job is to build a model to find out which drug might be appropriate for a future patient with the same illness. The feature sets of this dataset are Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol of patients, and the target is the drug that each patient responded to.**


you will learn a popular machine learning algorithm, Decision Trees. You will use this classification algorithm to build a model from the historical data of patients, and their response to different medications. Then you will use the trained decision tree to predict the class of an unknown patient, or to find a proper drug for a new patient.
